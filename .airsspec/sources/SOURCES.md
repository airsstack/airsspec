## Usage Notes

### For Researchers
- Use these sources as reference material when creating `requirements.md`
- Cite specific findings when justifying technical decisions
- The `spec-framework-analysis.md` is particularly relevant for understanding executable specifications

### For Architects
- `agentic-workflows-and-tui.md` contains workflow patterns that inform architecture decisions
- `ai-dlc-analysis.md` defines the phase structure used throughout AirsSpec

### For Managers
- All sources can be referenced in RFC.md when planning implementation
- Use these documents to validate Bolt scope and task definitions
